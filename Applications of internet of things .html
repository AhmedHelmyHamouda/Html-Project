            <li>Smart Homes:- Smart homes are most trendy among these applications. The vision of a smart home is to control home appliances including lights, water flow from taps home security and safety. House owner gets access to control and monitor these actions from their smart devices (smartphones, tablets, laptops). Imagine a situation that you forgot to turn off a water tap, you are already out of your home. You can just turn off from your phone. Smart homes allow you to manage all your home devices from one place. One can also use a security camera under the IoT facility to avoid thefts and robbery</li>

            <li>(IoT) connected factory: The new buzz in the industrial sector, also called the Industrial Internet of Things (IoT), is the industrial internet.<br></br>It empowers industrial engineering to create brilliant machines with sensors, software and big data analytics. Applications for tracking goods, real-time exchange of inventory information between suppliers and retailers and automated delivery will increase the efficiency of the supply chain.</li>
            <li>Health and Fitness: To help you stay fit, IoT-connected devices are here. Fitness trackers help you track your daily activities such as sleeping patterns, heart rate, patterns of activity, statistics of workouts, calories burned, etc. It is now possible to place sensors on clothing and monitor some signals. .<br></br>This sensor collects data through skin contact and transmits information to smartphones and remote diagnostic devices.</li>

            <li>Internet of Nano-Things:- The IoNT is made up of linked Nano devices through current network and telecommunications systems. The IoNT added a fresh aspect to the IoT by incorporating Nano sensors into devices to allow them to interact globally between systems around the globe through the Nano network and the Internet. The IoNT defines how the Internet will grow as Nano sensors connect to physical stuff like physical resources or consumer devices to collect, process and share information with end customers. IoNT has various important applications such as smart agriculture, health care, military, logistics, aerospace, industrial control systems, manufacturing, and smart cities.
