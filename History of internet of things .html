<h3>The IOT concept was coined by a member of the Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) development community in 1999, and it has recently become more relevant to the practical world largely because of the growth of mobile devices,embedded and ubiquitous communication, cloud computing and data analytics</h3>
<br></br><h3>Internet of Things is a new revolution of the Internet. Objectsmake themselves recognizable and they obtain intelligence by making or enabling context related decisions thanks to the fact that they can communicate information about themselves.<br></br>They can access information that has been aggregated by other things, or they can be components of complex services.<br></br>The goal of the Internet of Things is to enable things to be connected anytime, anyplace, with anything and anyone ideally using any path/network and any service.</h3>
